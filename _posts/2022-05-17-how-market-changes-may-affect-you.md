Today I want to go over what’s going on in our real estate market as a whole and discuss how the current changes will affect buyers and homeowners. The increasing interest rates are the biggest real estate news right now, so I’ll provide a brief history of rates and why they’re rising. I’ll also talk about the question that’s worrying many people these days: Is our market going to crash? The brief answer is that there’s no crash on the horizon.&nbsp;
