Unemployment has reached record-highs across the country, but fortunately, in our area, we’re fairly insulated. I’m certainly not intending to downplay the experience of those who have been affected by unemployment here, but I am saying that **the majority of our buyers are military—and the military isn’t laying anyone off.** Our community largely doesn’t have to worry about sudden, sweeping disappearance of income.&nbsp;

As of June 2020, we’re actually not seeing any change in our real estate market and, for the most part, people’s ability to buy hasn’t been hindered. Again, I stress *for the most part* because there will always be those of us who are, unfortunately, affected more directly by COVID-19 and the ensuing economic shock.&nbsp;

So how has the PCS stop order movement affected the market? Initially, it caused a total freak out, but so far, it honestly hasn’t changed things much in practice; **we’re almost afraid that when the PCS moves do open back up, we won’t have enough houses on the market to sell to the incoming buyers.&nbsp;**

what that means: If you want to put your home up for sale for any reason, now’s the time to do so. I’m not trying to hype up anything—as a real estate professional, I always want you to do what’s best for your situation. That being said, it’s my job to let you know that our market is craving homes, and there are plenty of buyers who need them; it’s hard to think of a time when sellers had a better advantage than they do right now.&nbsp;

Despite the PCS stop movement, **we actually have more homes being sold now than we’ve had in the last five to 10 years,** and prices are as high as they’ve been since I got into real estate nearly a decade ago. &nbsp;The vital signs of the military market here vary. If you have questions about the PCS stop movement order, buying or selling homes, or recent market data, please reach out by phone or email anytime. I’m here to be your resource, and I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
