I hope you are having a fantastic start to the year. I wanted to take a few minutes and update you on what’s happening in the Fort Bragg real estate market so that you can make educated decisions on your real estate goals this year.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**We are still in a very strong seller’s market.** If you have a home to sell, you’re coming out on top. Prices are up, and right now, we’re sitting at an average home price of $225,000. In some areas, that average is actually higher. Prices have risen about $30,000 in the last 12 months, so you will get more for your home than you would have ever received in the past.&nbsp;

Even though we aren’t seeing the bidding wars we had earlier, **you’ll still get solid offers with great terms.** Everything that buyers used to ask for, like closing costs and warranties, aren’t flying anymore. The days on market is a little bit longer; homes aren’t selling as quickly. However, we are still under two weeks at the most.&nbsp;

We are committed to giving you real estate tips, tricks, and tactics this year. So if you have questions about any topic we cover or just real estate in general, feel free to call or email us. We are also happy to give you a home valuation if you’re thinking about selling. We hope you have an amazing 2022\!
