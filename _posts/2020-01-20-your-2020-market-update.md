Hello everyone, I’m Deanna Watson, owner of the Signature Group Real Estate Team here in Fayetteville, North Carolina. I’m starting a video series where I discuss some of the great things happening in the real estate market and in our area, and how they could affect you. I can’t wait to keep you informed\! Since it’s the beginning of the year, I’m starting with a market update for our area.&nbsp;

Some people say we’re in a buyer’s market, and others say we’re in a seller’s market. Based on the statistics and my professional opinion, **I believe we’re in a balanced market.** Depending on your situation, you could be leaning more toward either a buyer’s or seller’s market. As we’re in the middle, some neighborhoods will be different than others.&nbsp;

[In a seller’s market, there are usually more buyers for homes than there are homes for sale](https://deana.ftbraggnchomefinder.com/property-report/){: target="_blank"}. This means those are the houses that are getting multiple offers, selling over asking price, and whose sellers are in a better position to negotiate. A buyer’s market means there are more months of inventory on the market than there are buyers to buy them. Homes will sit on the market longer, and you may have to reduce the price.&nbsp;

In the majority of areas, we’re seeing homes sell in less than two months. This matters because two to three years ago, houses were taking around 100 days to sell. In many areas, homes are selling in less than 30 days right now. Our team’s average days on market for 2019 was 28. This is great because the average for all real estate in the area is a minimum of 58 days. **We’re getting houses sold faster than everyone else right now** because of our excellent marketing strategy.&nbsp;

How does a buyer’s or a seller’s market affect your pricing? If you’re in a seller’s market, a seller has more negotiating power. This means multiple buyers will be looking at your property, and hopefully, multiple offers will be submitted to you in the first week. If you’re in a multiple offer situation as a seller, you have the upper hand because you get to go with the most attractive offer. You can also do things such as not pay for all of the closing costs, not pay for home warranties, and not take a price reduction. These are all wonderful things for you.

[If you’re in a buyer’s market as a buyer, you will have the upper hand on the seller.](https://deana.ftbraggnchomefinder.com/results-gallery/?county=5352&amp;sort=importdate&amp;status=A){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;A buyer is better able to negotiate on price. Unfortunately for the seller, they’re going to have to spend more to get their home sold.&nbsp;

The **most critical thing if you’re considering selling your home is to chat with someone about whether your property is in a buyer’s or seller’s market.** Of course, we can help you with that. We would love to help you, but if it’s not us, please make sure you’re well-informed.&nbsp;

Things have shifted—this is not how our market has always been. Back in 2014, sellers were basically having to give their homes away. So, if you’re considering selling your home anytime soon, you need to find an agent who sells a lot of properties and keeps up with these trends.&nbsp;

Look for our next video in a couple of weeks. If you have further questions about our current market or concerning real estate in general, please reach out to me via phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you\!
