Today I have a quick update for you on the real estate market here in Fayetteville. The first thing I want to point out is the following statistic, which is especially important for home sellers:

**The average days on market for our MLS right now is just 19 days.** When I first came here five or six years ago, the average was in the 80-day range. Additionally, the average days on market for our team’s listings is just two to three days. Almost everything we’ve listed lately has sold within 24 hours. If there was ever a time to get top dollar for your home, it’s now.&nbsp;

**This is the only time I've ever seen the list-to-sale price ratio at 100% or higher.** This means that sellers are getting at least their asking price, if not more. This is the fifth month in a row that we’ve seen these conditions.

Finally, that brings me to the highest median price of all time. The average sold price for June so far is $190,000. That’s a big deal, because over the last few years we’ve been down around $150,000. **If you haven't checked out what your home is worth on today’s market, we can give you a free estimate right here on our site.**

If you have any other questions or real estate needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
