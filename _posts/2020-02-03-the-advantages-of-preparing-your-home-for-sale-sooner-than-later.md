Right around this time of year is when many in the armed services are notified of their Permanent Change of Station (PSC) moves. Sometimes, people wait to contact us until a month before their move, while others wait all the way up until they’re practically on their way out of town.&nbsp;

Today I’m offering some reasons why you should reach out to us sooner than later:&nbsp;

**1\. You have time on your side.** Depending on when you’re moving, you probably have at least a month or more to get things squared away. Keep in mind that, if you do need to make home improvements before you sell, waiting until the last minute means spending all of that money at once.&nbsp;

If you let us come to your house now and give you an evaluation about what we think you should fix, you’ll have ample time to layer those payments in.&nbsp;

**2\. Unique changes in the market.** Market conditions are markedly different now than when you purchased your home. No matter if you bought your home last year, or three years ago, there’s never been a better time to be a seller than right now. Whereas just a few years ago buyers could expect sellers to front all the closing costs, today’s market has shifted to favor sellers.

Not only will you likely avoid having to cover a buyer’s closing costs, you may also get to enjoy a multiple-offer situation.&nbsp;

**3\. The beauty of our spring can be a benefit.** The prettiest time of year in our area is usually around March or April. If you’re moving in June, you’d normally wait until May to call, but think about the azalea bushes and dogwood trees that are about to bloom soon. Everything that would be a photographer's dream for a front yard photo is blooming in as soon as a month and a half.&nbsp;

<br>If you know for sure that you’ll be making a move in 2020, go ahead and reach out to me. I can visit your house free of charge and find out what steps you’ll need to take to get market-ready. Once we have a gameplan in order, we’ll reconvene later to pick a date.&nbsp;

For those who have no intention of moving this year, I’d still love to give you a free assessment and/or answer any real estate questions you may have. The Signature Group Realty Team and I are always here to help.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
