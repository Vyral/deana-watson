If you’re ready to sell your home and want to update it before listing, the two most important rooms to focus on are the kitchen and bathroom(s).

Having a renovated kitchen goes a long way for a couple of reasons. First, **it photographs very well.** When buyers scroll through your home’s photos online, the kitchen is the first thing they look for—followed by the bathrooms and backyard—before evaluating the rest of the property.&nbsp;

A kitchen renovation can be a big undertaking, so you don’t have to upgrade the whole thing. If you live in an older neighborhood or a home that’s older than 10 or 15 years, watch what your neighbors are doing with their homes. If they’re renovating their kitchens and/or the rest of their home, do one small update at a time so you’re ready to compete once your home hits the market.&nbsp;

There’s nothing worse than having a Realtor walk into your home and break the news that your kitchen needs a lot of updates. It’s our job to make sure your home sells quickly and for top dollar, and the kitchen is one of the areas that makes that happen. If yours isn’t updated, consider taking on one project at a time so we don’t have to advise you to make a ton of expensive upgrades at once.&nbsp;

Regarding your bathrooms, **if you live in a home that was built before the year 2000, it’s probably time to upgrade.** Make sure the fixtures are updated, but don’t create a modern-looking bathroom if the rest of your home is more traditional looking. Stick with the aesthetic of the rest of your home so the bathrooms don’t stick out. If you have brass fixtures, consider replacing them with bronze or nickel ones. Framing your mirror and switching the grates on your floor also go a long way.&nbsp;

If your home was built before the ‘90s, consider upgrading the tile as well. I was at a listing appointment just the other day for a home that was built back in the ‘70s, and its bathroom tile was pink. You can imagine how hard of a sell that would be to modern buyers.&nbsp;
