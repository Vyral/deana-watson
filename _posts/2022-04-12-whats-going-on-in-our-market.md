{% include excerpt.html %}<br>The Fayetteville market is still very strong, and we’re still winning offers for buyers. We ended up with 18 offers on a property we put up for sale a few days ago, and we’re sometimes getting tens of thousands of dollars over asking price for our sellers with very little inconvenience. We're in the top 10 of our MLS for average sale price.

**We’re entering PCS season 2022, and we don't have enough inventory** for the number of buyers we have coming in. I want to remind you that you don't have to put your home on the market to sell it. If you would like the convenience of not having to put your home up for sale, we probably have a buyer that will buy your home.&nbsp;

If that's something you're interested in, reach out to us. **We have a solution no matter what the challenge is.** We would be very grateful if you can help us get inventory.

If you have any questions or are interested in a free market analysis report, don’t hesitate to email us at [deana@signaturegroupteam.com](mailto:deana@signaturegroupteam.com). We would love to hear from you.
