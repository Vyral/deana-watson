In the last seven days, many of us have been stuck at home and a lot of nonessential businesses have closed. However, the real estate market hasn’t stopped—we are considered an essential industry in this area. That means we’re still allowed to work as long as we comply with social distancing and other CDC measures to halt the spread of the virus.

**Here are some market statistics from the last seven days to show that real estate is still going:**

* 185 people have listed their homes for sale
* 262 homes have gone under contract, which is 80 more than the previous week
* 217 more homes closed than the previous week
* Around 80 homes have been purchased at above-market value

In short: We’re still closing transactions at a faster rate than people are listing their homes for sale, which shows that we’re still in a strong seller’s market. So yes, **if you still need to sell your home, you can\!&nbsp;**

We as **agents are taking extra precautions to make sure that your family stays safe and healthy.** We’ll also provide you with cleaning supplies to clean your home before and after people come in to view it. Further, we’ve been leveraging video tours for everyone’s home, as well as Matterport tours which allow people to walk through your house without actually having to step foot inside it.

So, to concerned homeowners: The sky is not falling. There are still plenty of great things happening in our market, and **if you need to sell your home, now is the best time to do it.** We’ve been able to sell some homes for $20,000 or $30,000 over their purchase prices.

If you have any questions about the market or how to sell your home during the pandemic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. In the meantime, stay safe and healthy\!
